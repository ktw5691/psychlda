\title{Generic function to retrieve the top topics for each document}
\usage{
get_toptopics(mcmc_fit, burn = 0, thin = 1, stat = "mean")

}
\arguments{
\item{mcmc_fit}{An Lda object.}

\item{burn}{The number of draws to discard as a burn-in period. Default: 0.}

\item{thin}{The number of draws to skip as a thinning period. Default: 1 (no thinning).}

\item{stat}{The summary statistic to use on the posterior draws. Default: mean.}

\item{nwords}{The number of words to retrieve.}

\item{vocab}{A character vector containing the vocabulary.}

\item{method}{If "termscore", use term scores (similar to tf-idf). If "prob",
use probabilities. Default: "termscore".}
